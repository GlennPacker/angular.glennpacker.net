                    later with the emergance of MVC3 the Razor syntax. Glenn has kept abreast of all these developments and still uses HTML

                    Demands on styling a website are stronger now than ever. Every site needs to be responsive and attractive on any device,
                    from phone to destop and in every browser. To help with these growing demands, in recent years there has been a flurry
                    of new CSS frameworks, the biggest of which is Twitter's Bootstrap. Glenn has built this site using Bootstrap.

                    Glenn Packer has been writing JavaScript for over 15 years. For a long time JavaScript was just a way to animate
                    somthing on a page, this was made easier by the emergance jQuery and jQuery UI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then Ajax was born, giving the ability to use Javascript to retrieve smaller parts of the page directly from the server.
                    This huge breakthrough changed the face of JavaScript. JavaScript and its Frameworks, such as Angular, Vue Js and React
                    are today some of the most sort after skills on the market.
